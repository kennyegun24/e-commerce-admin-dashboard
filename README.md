# Ecommerce Admin Dashboard

This is the admin dashboard for the full stack e-commerce website I created.

Only an admin is allowed to perform some operations such as...
- Create a new store with email and password parameters.
- Create a new category.
- Add new products based on category and product must belong to a store.
- An admin can see all orders made by users
- All customers.
- All products.
- Admin can see charts describing the metrics of the store and how well or bad sales are.
- Admin can see stores based on total worth, total sales made, total amount of goods in.
